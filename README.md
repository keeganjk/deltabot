## What is it? <a id="what-is-it">
Deltabot is a simplistic <a href="discordapp.com">Discord</a> bot that only offers a few features and allows you to change it to your desire. It is made simply for the purpose of people to make their own bots to do anything they want. The basics come pre-coded, so all you need to do is add what you want. Delta (Î”) is a Greek character that represents change in mathematics. This bot is called Deltabot because you are supposed to change it.
## How to use it <a id="how-to-use">
> ### 1. Download <a id="dl">
> Firstly, on any OS, you would navigate to https://github.com/keeganjk/deltabot. Once on this page, click the button that says "Clone or Download" and then "Download as ZIP".
